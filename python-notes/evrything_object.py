"""
    In pyhton everything is a object.
    pyhton is a object oriented programming language.
    As in pyhton everything is a object the datatypes are also implemented as calsses internally.
    When we decalre a variable and assign a value during the execution the python will recognise it
        and keeps it in the required class.
    If it is 
            integer type data then that data will be kept in int class.
            floating number type data then it will be kept in float class.
            complex number type data then it will be kept in complex class.
            boolean type data then it will be kept in bool class.
            string type data then it will be kept in str class.

    * Built in data types/classes are implimented in a differnt way in pyhton not like how we define classes.
    * We dont know how the datatypes/ classes are implemented in pyhton
    * But when we refer to the variable it will give the data.
    * We know that every class consist of two things 1) data 2) object
    * When we are creating a variable the value we give is data but pyhton will interpret it and creates it as a onject in pyhton.

    * In python data types are treated as classes because these classes will tell how to interpret the 
        data in memory.
    * In Python every value has a data type, since everything is an object in Python, data types are actually classes, variables being their objects.

    * In python data types are different their classes are different
            Datatype            class
            integers            int
            floating numbers    float
            complex numbers     complex
            strings             str
            lists               list
            tuples              typle
            sets                set

    * the data of datatype is stored in the memory and they can be interpreted correctly using their classes.
        a = 1
        here 1 is data of integers type
             a is object of int class
        b = 12.22
        here 12.22 is data of type floating numbers
             b is object of float class
        str1 = "hi how are ypu"
        here "hi how are ypu" is data of string data type 
             str1 is object of str class
             strings data can be interpreted by the str class
        

                __________
                |        |
                | object | -------> a  
                |        |
                |________|

         when we access a it will give the data in the object.
         class will interpret the data in the object.
