1) What is python?
    python is a high level interpreter language.
    python is developed based on c and c++ programming

2) python interpreter
    python is a interpreter language
    Interpretes/executes code line by line unlike other languages
    other languages like c (compiler based), they first compile and then execute.

3) Varible declaration and Dynamic typing:
    In python we don't need to declare the variables specifically,
    we can give a varible and assign value to it.
        syntax: <variable name> = <value>
        ex: var = 12 or var = "hi"
    No need to specify the data type before declaring variables
    The variable type will be converted to the assigned datatype value,
        this is known as Dynamic typing.
    -> In python we no need to keep the semicolon(';') after every line.
        both will work same if we keep the semicolon or not
        var = 1  or var = 1;
    -> whenever we declare assign a new type value to the variable 
        type of variable will change

4) Basic data types
    a) integer type:
        values ranges from ...-3,-2,-1,0,1,2,3... (-infinity to +infinity)
        var = 2; -> 'var' is a variable of integer type
        we can use int function -> int('25') -> can convert str to integer 
    b) floating type:
        values ranging from -p/q to p/q
        var = 2.5 -> 'var' is a varible of float type
        we can use float function -> float(1) -> converts integer to float
        float('1.2') -> converts string to float  
    c) boolean type:
        values are of 'True' or 'False'
        val = True  or val = False -> 'var' is a varible of boolean type
        we can consider 0 as False and 1 as True
    d) complex type:
        values are of complex
        var = complex(1,2)  =~ 1+2j
